  Consent for Participation in Experiments, Data Use, and Data Storage<br><br>

  Study title:	Pragmatics of linguistic communication<br><br>
  Principal Investigator:	Dr Hannah Rohde<br><br>
  Researcher Collecting Data: Vinicius Macuch Silva<br><br>

  <b>Nature of the study.</b> You are about to participate in a study which involves reading sentences carefully, answering questions about them, or writing text after a short sentence prompt. Before you start, we will have some questions about you (e.g., age, gender, language background). Your responses will be recorded. Your session should last for up to 5 minutes. You will be given full instructions shortly.<br><br>

  <b>Compensation.</b> You will be paid at the posted rate for your participation in this study.<br><br>

  <b>Risks and benefits.</b>  There are no known risks to participation in this study. Other than the payment mentioned, there are no tangible benefits to you, however you will be contributing to our knowledge about language.
  <br><br>

  <b>Confidentiality and use of data.</b> All the information we collect during the course of the research will be processed in accordance with Data Protection Law. In order to safeguard your privacy, we will never share personal information (like your name) with anyone outside the research team. Your data will be referred to by a unique participant number rather than by name). Please note that we will temporarily collect your participant ID to prevent repeated participation, however we will never share this information with anyone outside the research team. We will store any personal data (i.e., participant ID) securely using the University of Osnabr&uuml;ck’s storage systems. The anonymised data collected during this study will be used for research purposes and may be shared with other researchers or with the general public (e.g., we may make it available through the world wide web, or use it in TV or radio broadcasts).
  <br><br>

  <b>What are my data protection rights?</b> The University of Edinburgh is a Data Controller for the information you provide.  You have the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance Data Protection Law. You also have other rights including rights of correction, erasure and objection.  For more details, including the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office, please visit www.ico.org.uk.  Questions, comments and requests about your personal data can also be sent to the University Data Protection Officer at dpo@ed.ac.uk.
  <br><br>

  <b>Voluntary participation and right to withdraw.</b> Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If you withdraw from the study after data gathering, we will delete your data and there is no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. To withdraw from the study after data gathering please contact the research team within a week of participation by providing your prolific participant ID. After this deadline we will delete the participant IDs which means we won’t be able to identify you to delete your data.
